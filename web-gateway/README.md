# web-gateway
web-gateway is a SCION web server that proxies web content from the TCP/IP web
to the SCION web.

## Installation

Build the `scion-web-gateway` binary by running `make scion-web-gateway` (see
[Build](../README.md#build) in the main README).

## Usage

This requires a running SCION endhost stack, i.e. a running SCION dispatcher
and SCION daemon. Please refer to '[Running](../../README.md#Running)' in this
repository's main README and the [SCIONLab tutorials](https://docs.scionlab.org) to get started.

Start the gateway, telling it which TCP/IP hosts it should be mirroring:
```
bin/scion-ip-gateway scionlab.org www.scionlab.org www.scion-architecture.net
```

Note that the names we specify are individual host names, not domains, and
every subdomain needs to be listed separately.

While this server is running, you can access these websites over SCION, either
using the [`scion-bat`](../bat/README.md) command line tool, or using the
[`scion-skip`](../skip/README.md) browser integration.

First, add a hostname entry for the mirrored hosts, pointing it to the SCION
address that the gateway is running, e.g. add the following line to `/etc/scion/hosts`:
```
17-ffaa:1:a,127.0.0.1 scionlab.org www.scionlab.org www.scion-architecture.net
```

Then simply access it:
```
bin/scion-bat http://www.scion-architecture.net/pages/publications/
bin/scion-bat https://www.scion-architecture.net/pages/publications/
```
