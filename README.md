# scion-apps

This repo contains demo applications using the SCION protocol.

The applications are written in Go, with some supporting code in Python. A SCION Internet connection (for instance via SCIONLab) is required to run these applications.

More information on [SCION](https://www.scion-architecture.net/), and [tutorials on how to set up SCION and SCIONLab](https://netsec-ethz.github.io/scion-tutorials/).

To build any project, first run once the provided script `deps.sh` and you should be ready to _go_ :) . This script will pull all vendor dependencies and prepare this directory to build any project.

## roughtime

Implementation of server and client applications, running the "roughtime" protocol over the SCION network. Roughtime is a project that aims to provide secure time synchronisation. More information on the project can be found on the [original repository](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime)


## webapp

Webapp is a Go application that will serve up a static web portal to make it easy to experiment with SCIONLab test apps on a virtual machine.

Installation and usage information is available on the [SCION Tutorials web page for webapp](https://netsec-ethz.github.io/scion-tutorials/as_visualization/webapp/).


## helloworld
